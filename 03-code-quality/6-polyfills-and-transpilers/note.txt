how to make our modern code work on older engines that don’t understand recent features yet?
There are two tools for that:

- Transpilers.
  A transpiler is a special piece of software that translates source code to another source code.
  JavaScript before year 2020 didn’t have the “nullish coalescing operator” ??. So, if a visitor uses an outdated browser, it may fail to understand the code like height = height ?? 100.

  A transpiler would analyze our code and rewrite height ?? 100 into (height !== undefined && height !== null) ? height : 100.

- Polyfills.
  A script that updates/adds new functions is called “polyfill”. It “fills in” the gap and adds missing implementations.
